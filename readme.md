This is my captone project for udacity's machine learning nanodegree. The data for the project is taken from the kaggle competition site (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data).

In this repository, you will find all of my capstone project work, including the ipython notebook, proposal, and the report.
